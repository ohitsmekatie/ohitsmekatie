## 👋 Hi, I’m Katie

I'm a versatile data practitioner with over a decade of experience across product management, data engineering, analytics engineering, and data analyst roles. I’ve worked in dev tools, e-commerce, and ed-tech, partnering with cross-functional teams to deliver insights, build scalable pipelines, and champion a data-driven culture. In my non-work time I love to volunteer at causes that are important to me and also play role play games. 🧙‍♀️


## 🧪 Featured Projects

### 🪄 [Lore & More](https://github.com/ohitsmekatie/ohitsmetables) 

I built this site to help with role playing game prep using the following:

- 🐍 Flask for the backend
- 🖋️ Poetry for dependency management
- 💻 Render for deploying
- 🗞️ Google Sheets for a dynamic, easy to populate "database"
- 💄 Bootstrap + custom CSS
- ✨ Font Awesome for icons

The site features a few random content generators for world building and also a "random inspiration" container that refreshes with each page load.
