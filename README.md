# 👋 Hi, I’m Katie

I'm a versatile data practitioner with over a decade of experience across data engineering, analytics engineering, and data analyst roles. I’ve worked in dev tools, e-commerce, and ed-tech, partnering with cross-functional teams to deliver insights, build scalable pipelines, and champion a data-driven culture. In my non-work time I love to volunteer at causes that are important to me (412 Food Rescue, Case San Jose) and also play role play games. 🧙‍♀️
