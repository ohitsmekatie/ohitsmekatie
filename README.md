## 👋 Hi, I’m Katie

I'm a data practitioner with over a decade of experience across product management, data engineering, analytics engineering, and data analyst roles. I’ve worked in dev tools, e-commerce, and ed-tech, partnering with cross-functional teams to deliver insights, build scalable pipelines, and champion a data-driven culture. In my non-work time I love to volunteer at causes that are important to me and also play tabletop role playing games like DnD. 🧙‍♀️

I'm currently working at Brooklyn Data Co. as an **Analytics Engineer.**
